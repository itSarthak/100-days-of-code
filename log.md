# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 2, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I started with node.js from udemy course, understanding how JavaScript works outside web browsers and setting up node.js on the machine.

**Thoughts:** I was unable to start DSA today, will extra hard tomorrow to start dsa and get deeper into Node.js

### Day 1: July 3, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: 
- Created a simple web server, explored modules and async nature of Node.js
- Completed L1 of Linked List | Striver, practiced 5 Basic LL questions.
- Made reusable HTML/CSS components.

**Thoughts:** Today was overall really productive, created 3 HTML and CSS components and delved deep into Node.js. I feel restless if I will be able to carry this strak forward.

### Day 2: July 4, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: 
- Delved further into concepts of Node.js, learned about routine, and made a simple web API to fetch data.
- Made web application layouts in HTML CSS 
- Unfortunately, I couldn't make time for DSA today

**Thoughts:** While I wanted to learn and do more I was bound by some other work so couldn't invest as much time as I'd like to but I am happy I still got to code today. Also, I feel restlessness after EOD, as if I am still lagging so much behind. 


### Day 3: July 5, Friday

**Today's Progress**: 
- Made a simple Node.js application which fetches the data from a json file

**Thoughts:** I find Node.js interesting and now I somewhat regret not learning it earlier. But there are plenty of other technologies that I haven't explored yet which might be interesting, so there's no point regretting. I am excited about the on-campus placement drive tomorrow.


### Day 4: July 6, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: 
- Attended #leetcode biweekly contest 134, able to solve (1/4) problems only.

**Thoughts:** I couldn't do much today as I had a really bad headache and placement drive ate all my day today. I was unable to make it through the first round only, although I knew 2/3 questions I was not well-versed with hackerearth environment which led me to fail the first round. I will focus more on dsa now. Also in the contest I was able to do only (1/4) questions, I am very disappointed in myself.

### Day 5: July 7, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: 
- Made a calculator application with HTML, css and js, covered some test cases but some are yet to be covered. Will cover them in the upcoming week
- Made a qrcode generator in python, it was super fun and easy. I will make some more next weekend

**Thoughts:** It was a fun day overall, spent most of my time coding, had a call with someone who made me realise that I still don't know anything and there's a long journey ahead. I need to put atleast 6 more months into upskilling in MERN stack to call myself recruitable. I will grind a lot of DSA tomorrow.

### Day 6: July 8, Monday

**Today's Progress**: 
- Completed Node Farm application | Learned basic APIs, NPM, and versioning.
- Revised Hashing & Sorting - I from striver | Solved easy 6 dsa questions.

**Thoughts:** Most of my day got eaten up by dsa, tomorrow the first thing I am doing after waking up is development. I feel more that I am getting control over life and yes I am somewhat late but at least I am here, learning and making efforts.

### Day 7: July 9, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: 
I did a lot of Development, but couldn't practice DSA today
- Started another project following @jonasschmedtman
- Made progress in Node.js, and learned how req/res works

**Thoughts:** It was a somewhat productive day, most of the time was spent building or learning web development. I would like to spend more time learning DSA but I cannot divide time between dsa and development properly.

### Day 8: July 10, Monday

**Today's Progress**: 
Felt under the weather today, so I mostly practiced DSA questions and called it a day.

**Thoughts:** I have developed major back pain due to prolonged sitting, it is hindering in my learning process. I need to fix it somehow
