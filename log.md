# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 2, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I started with node.js from udemy course, understanding how JavaScript works outside web browsers and setting up node.js on the machine.

**Thoughts:** I was unable to start DSA today, will extra hard tomorrow to start dsa and get deeper into Node.js

### Day 1: July 3, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: 
- Created a simple web server, explored modules and async nature of Node.js
- Completed L1 of Linked List | Striver, practiced 5 Basic LL questions.
- Made reusable HTML/CSS components.

**Thoughts:** Today was overall really productive, created 3 HTML and CSS components and delved deep into Node.js. I feel restless if I will be able to carry this strak forward.

### Day 2: July 4, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: 
- Delved further into concepts of Node.js, learned about routine, and made a simple web API to fetch data.
- Made web application layouts in HTML CSS 
- Unfortunately, I couldn't make time for DSA today

**Thoughts:** While I wanted to learn and do more I was bound by some other work so couldn't invest as much time as I'd like to but I am happy I still got to code today. Also, I feel restlessness after EOD, as if I am still lagging so much behind.
